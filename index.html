  <div class='intro-text'>
    <br>
    <p>On Sept. 30, 2021, the inaugural Diversity Report of The Daily Princetonian was <a
        href="https://projects.dailyprincetonian.com/diversity-report-2021/index.html">published</a> — the report served
      as a reflection of one of many first steps of dedication to diversity and inclusion at the ‘Prince.’ Not only did
      we learn about the many backgrounds that comprise the ‘Prince’ community, but the report allowed us to analyze how
      this impacted our news coverage and journalistic practices as a whole.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We received a lot of valuable feedback from the inaugural report and prioritized implementing changes both within
      our coverage and within the organization at large. Some highlights of the 146th Managing Board include special
      issues centering on <a
        href="https://projects.dailyprincetonian.com/queer-remembrances-queer-futures/">queerness</a>,
      <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2022/02/path-science-future-einstein-staff">scientific
        research</a>, and <a
        href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2022/12/black-voices-then-now-forever">Black voices</a>, all
      released with the hope of bringing coverage of these historically underrepresented communities to the forefront of
      our paper. We also created identity-specific affinity spaces for marginalized staffers and laid the groundwork for
      increasing community engagement with various leaders on campus.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>But there is still work to be done. Coverage of marginalized identities should not be limited to special issues;
      it should be consistent and comprehensive. Moreover, even beyond their affinity spaces, staff of marginalized
      identities should feel comfortable and empowered to contribute to and enact change within the organization.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This second annual diversity report includes responses from 244 members across the ‘Prince.’ In visualizing the
      data, it serves not only as a snapshot of the ‘Prince’ as a whole, but also as an accountability tool to track the
      progress we made since the first report was published. This report is a reflection of our successes and failures,
      and most importantly, demonstrates our commitment to improvement and growth. As we continue to grow and report
      with integrity, transparency and intentionality have become fundamental to our work. Now, as we reflect on 2022,
      we hope our report can be used as a chance to set new <a href="goals.html">goals</a> and think of new ways to engage with the many
      communities that build our campus.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We greatly appreciate Elaine Huang for making the accompanying data visualizations and graphs, Brett Zeligson for
      designing the web project, Katelyn Ryu and Noreen Hosny for designing the graphics, and Angel Kuo, who organized
      them. A tremendous thank you to Tanvi Nibhanupudi, Omar Farah, and Marie-Rose Sheinerman for their consistent
      support and guidance throughout the project. We would also like to thank Evelyn Doskoch, Alex Gjaja, Katherine
      Dailey, and Hope Perry for their meaningful written contributions and editing, as well as Naisha Sylvestre for
      cleaning the data. Lastly, a general thank you to every staffer who responded to our survey and left thoughtful
      feedback.</p>

    <p><i style="color: #0000007b">Note: This survey was conducted shortly after the fall recruitment
        cycle of the
        ‘Prince.’ Therefore, a
        majority of respondents were first-year staffers with limited experience at the ‘Prince,’ which may influence
        their opinions on ‘Prince’-specific issues.</i></p>
