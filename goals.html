      <p class="credit-heading"><strong>Goals</strong></p>
      <p>Based on the data collected in the Diversity Report, as well as the reflection and contributions of members of
        the ‘Prince,’ we have developed the following set of goals for the coming year. We are publishing them to our
        readership to encourage transparency and accountability.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="credit-heading"><strong>Community</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Continue to annually survey all staff and develop a similar report to evaluate the success of our diversity
          recruitment and inclusion efforts, which includes actively inviting historically underrepresented groups to
          affinity open houses.</li>
        <li>Pilot a relationship-building outreach initiative with identity-oriented groups on campus in the hopes of:
          <ul>
            <li>Building and rebuilding trust in ‘Prince’ coverage and recruitment</li>
            <li>Establishing consistent communication with historically overlooked or misrepresented communities</li>
            <li>Encouraging a direct channel for affinity groups to communicate with our reporters about events and
              general information</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Launch a DEI-specific internal feedback form to offer staffers a specific avenue for sharing things they may
          feel uncomfortable talking about with upper management, as it relates to identity and inclusion.</li>
        <li>Support informal staff-led affinity groups by pushing for ‘Prince’-sponsored social events.</li>
        <li>Recognize that our own staff <a
            href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2022/12/black-voices-representation-journalism-diversity-equity-inclusion">does
            not reflect</a> the diversity of the student body and correct these failures through continued targeted
          recruitment efforts and critically engaging with why staffers, especially those that are first-generation
          low-income, may feel uncomfortable joining and engaging with the 'Prince'.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <p class="credit-heading"><strong>Coverage</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Build upon the work of the 146th Board by continuing to publish special issues that provide visibility through specific coverage.</li>
        <li>Better integrate historically overlooked events and communities into our day-to-day production by:
          <ul>
            <li>Setting a specific time for diverse pitches in all content meetings</li>
            <li>Holding the editorial staff accountable for communicating and assigning these pitches</li>
            <li>Working with staffers to feel comfortable covering content from communities that may be different from their own</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Build upon <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2022/12/princeton-dei-resign-staff-athletics-share-lack-of-support">past coverage</a> of University DEI initiatives and statistics.</li>
      </ol>
